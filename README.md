# Application of Support Vector Classifier

## Purpose

To learn and understand how support vector classifier work and implement in machine learning and data science.

## Requires

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

## Implement

Problem 1
Generate a simulated two-class data set with 100 observations and two
features in which there is a visible but non-linear separation between the two classes. Show that in this setting, a support vector machine with polynomial kernel (with degree greater than 1) or a radial kernel will outperform a support vector classifier on the training data. Which technique performs best on the test data? Make plots and report training and test error rates in order to back up your assertions.

Problem 2
Use ‘Heart’ dataset. Remove if there is example with missing data. Split into 70-30 train test data. Fit Support Vector Classifier (Linear SVM) to the training data. Report training set and test set accuracy. Change value of C and plot training and test set accuracy with varied values of C.Provide your insights on the effect of changing C on training and test set accuracy. Experiment with other Kernels and report your findings about accuracy on Test data.
